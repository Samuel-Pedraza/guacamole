# Guacamole

Guacamole is a fun project that I'm building for myself to master more of the basics.

It's a blog.

It comprises a few things:
- Usage of Docker
- Building my own PHP API backend
- Buildng my own ORM
- Building a vue based CMS (small) to publish blogs
- Building a static front-end automatically generated HTML
- Building a CI/CD pipeline
- (long term) hosting on my own computer

There is a long ways to go and we are currently at the PHP API backend portion (mixed up with ORM)

This is just for fun and learning! :)


### ORM
- [ ] Database Connection
- [ ] Model generation
- [ ] model mapping (between model and table)
- [ ] model management
- [ ] Migration generation
- [ ] files to build migrations
- [ ] migration class and interpretation
- [ ] Migration management (which ones have run)
